All the sender programs are now obsolete. They have been replaced by writer and reader programs.
The writer program stores transactions and all their information as json data. The reader program reads the json
data and processes the transactions and stores the IDs. The receiver program functions the same as before. The entire suite of programs is now able to read/write/process ACH as well. All the programs are fully implemented and interoperable.
